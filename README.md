# The Golem Programming Language

Golem is a general purpose, interpreted language, with a dynamic type system.  Golem 
can be used as a command-line application, or it can be easily embedded inside 
a [Go](https://golang.org/) progam.

Golem brings together ideas from many other languages, including Go, Python, 
Javascript and Lua.

Please consult the [documentation](https://mjarmy.github.io/golem-lang/) to learn 
more about Golem.
