# The Golem Programming Language

Golem is a general purpose, interpreted language, with first-class 
functions and a dynamic type system.  Golem's primary use case is to be
embedded inside a Go program, similar to how Lua is designed to be 
embedded inside a C program.

Golem aims to combine the concurrency system of Go with the embeddability 
of Lua, while borrowing many good ideas from other scripting languages like
Python and Javascript.

**Golem is currently in alpha.  Its not yet ready for production use.**  

Please read the [Tutorial](Tutorial) 
to learn about Golem.

Consult the [Language Reference](Language-Reference) 
for a thorough description of Golem's features.
