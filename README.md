# The Golem Programming Language

Golem is a general purpose, interpreted language, with first-class 
functions and a dynamic type system.  Golem's primary use case is to be
embedded inside a Go program, similar to how Lua is designed to be 
embedded inside a C program.

Golem combines the concurrency system of Go with the embeddability 
of Lua, while borrowing many ideas from other scripting languages like
Python and Javascript.

**Golem is currently in alpha.  Its not yet ready for production use.**
