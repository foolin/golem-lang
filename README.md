# The Golem Programming Language

Golem is a general purpose, interpreted scripting language, that brings together ideas 
from many other languages, including Go, Python, Javascript and Lua.

Golem can be used as a full-fledged command-line application like `python3` or `node`, 
or it can be easily [embedded](https://github.com/mjarmy/golem-lang/blob/master/examples/embedding/sandbox.go) 
inside a [Go](https://golang.org/) progam.

Please consult the [documentation](https://mjarmy.github.io/golem-lang/) to learn 
more about Golem.

Golem is in beta:

* Reasonable care has been taken to ensure that it works.
* Golem's syntax and API are reasonably stable.
* There are likely to still be bugs lurking about.
