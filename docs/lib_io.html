<p>Module io provides basic interfaces to I/O primitives. Its primary job is to wrap existing implementations of such primitives, such as those in package os, into shared public interfaces that abstract the functionality, plus some other related primitives.</p>
<p>Because these interfaces and primitives wrap lower-level operations with various implementations, unless otherwise informed clients should not assume they are safe for parallel execution.</p>
<p><code>io</code> has the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="lib_ioioutil.html">ioutil</a></li>
</ul>
