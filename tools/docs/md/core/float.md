## Float

Float is the set of all IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point numbers.

Valid operators for Float are:

* The equality operators `==`, `!=`
* The comparison operators `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `<=>`
* The arithmetic operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
* The postfix operators `++`, `--`

Applying an arithmetic operator to a Float always returns a Float.

Floats are [`hashable`](#TODO)

Float has no fields.
