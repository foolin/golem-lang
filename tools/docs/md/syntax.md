## Syntax

### Operator precedence

Golem's operators have the following precedence, from low to high:

| Category       | Operators     |
| -------------  | ------------- |
| or             | <code>&#124;&#124;</code>  |
| and            | `&&`  |
| comparative    | `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `<=>` |
| additive       | `+`, `-`, <code>&#124;</code>, `^` |
| multiplicative | `*`, `/`, `%`, `&`, `<<`, `>>` |
| unary          | `-`, `!`, `~` |
| incremental    | `++`, `--`  |

The unary operators are prefix, the incremental operators are postfix, and 
all of the other operators are infix.
